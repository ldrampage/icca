1. Read Ingredient Lists

Quality products are made from ingredients of great quality. You should avoid skincare products with harmful, toxic ingredients. Only a few ingredients are banned in the United States as there aren't many regulations related to skincare. Understanding skincare ingredients is vital, but it can get confusing at times. Parabens, artificial fragrance, propylene glycol, and mineral oil are some of the ingredients you should look out for. 

The Environmental Working Group provides more information on this. Seventeen of our products bear the EWG Verified mark. Learn more about how to read an ingredient label. 

2. Wear Sun Screen

Most skin aging problems are caused by sun exposure. Excessive exposure to the sun causes dehydration and serious damage to the skin. Wearing sunscreen is one of the best ways to protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. Wear sun-protective clothing and avoid staying out in the sun for long periods. 

Wearing sunscreen every day is recommended. Look for a sunscreen lotion that is perfect for everyday wear. 

3. Drink Water

Our skin requires water. Water hydrates the skin from the inside out. Skin that lacks moisture tends to look dull, has more noticeable lines, and itchy. Dehydration also makes the areas around your nose and eyes look darker. 

Some of the drinks that cause skin dehydration are coffee and alcohol. Make sure to drink lots of water, so your skin stays healthy and hydrated. You can avoid dehydration by exercising, getting good sleep, and eating fruits and vegetables. 

4. Use A Moisturizer

Whatever skin type you have - whether it's oily, dry, combination, mature, or acne-prone - using a moisturizer daily is essential. Proper skin moisturization helps you avoid dry, flaky skin and keep your skin cells at optimum performance. Thus, it can help keep wrinkles and fine lines from appearing. Find a specific product that contains a moisturizer and serum for hydrating and nourishing the skin. 

Also, pick a moisturizer that can be applied to any lines or wrinkles on your face that requires some special attention. This is a skincare step that you shouldn't miss. 

5. Breathe Clean Air

Your skin's health can be affected by artificial fragrances, smoke from cigarettes, and heavy air pollution.  These things can generate harmful free radicals and may irritate your skin. If avoiding them is impossible, you can reach out for nontoxic products to help your skin repair itself. Damage to your skin can be helped with the use of products with antioxidants and natural and organic face wash. 

Additionally, breathing in fresh, clean air relaxes you and helps lower your stress. Now, you have one good reason to go outside and do something fun. 

6. Get More Sleep

To be well-rested, each of us needs 7 to 9 hours of good sleep every night. Our body requires sleep to be able to rejuvenate, restore, and repair itself properly. Indeed, "beauty sleep" is not just an empty phrase we love to use! When we sleep, our skin works on producing new collagen. 

It's like drinking from the fountain of youth every time you go to sleep each night. Moreover, following a regular schedule of going to bed and waking up allows you to achieve restful sleep. 

7. Wash Your Face

Properly washing your face eliminates oils and accumulated dirt and bacteria that make your pores seem bigger. Did you know that your face excretes natural oils at nighttime, and even your freshest pillows can contain teeny-tiny dirt? Thus, it is best to wash your face once you get out of bed to get rid of the collected oil and dirt while you were sleeping. It is also important to rewash your face to wipe out makeup and grime from the day before jumping into your bed. 

Washing your face post-workout or after you sweat is another essential you need to keep in mind. And, be sure to use a natural facial wash that's gentle on your skin when washing your face.
