1. It Softens Your Skin

Even though there are a lot of good products out there to moisturize the skin, a lot of them are too thick. Coconut oil is a perfect option without that heavy feeling throughout the day if you want soft and supple skin. It can soften the skin without being heavy, and it is refreshing. Even a small amount of coconut oil can make a huge difference in your skin. 

It can also be used for combination and oily skin. There is no reason to be fearful of using coconut oil for skin care. 

2. You Can Cleanse Your Face

You may find this hard to believe, but coconut oil works well for deep cleansing too. However, you shouldn't use it to cleanse your skin daily.  Instead, use it when you only need a good deep cleansing. Giving yourself a facial at home begins with a clean face with no dirt and oil and pores that are cleaned out. 

In terms of cleaning the face, coconut oil is good for that. To get rid of dead skin cells, make a scrub with either salt or sugar mixed with coconut oil. 

3. Remove Your Makeup

If you have been searching for a natural and healthy makeup remover,  you can stop looking. To remove makeup from your face, coconut oil works perfectly. It doesn't cause irritation or redness like other products made to remove makeup do, and it is gentle. You can use coconut oil to remove any makeup residue before your day begins. 

Coconut oil can easily remove all traces of waterproof mascara. To remove eye makeup, add some coconut oil to a cotton ball or swab. 

4. Treat Skin Disorders

Should you have a chronic skin problem like rosacea, psoriasis, or eczema, coconut oil is perfect. Coconut oil can be helpful in treating those types of conditions. This oil can limit the effect other products may have had on your skin. You may want a facial scrub or a good moisturizer, but if you have one of these skin conditions, those high-end or long-established drug store products are just too harsh for your sensitive skin. Coconut oil can replace those products. 

It is gentle on your face, and it is inexpensive as well, which will save you money. It also works on various skin issues and can be used as a spot treatment.
