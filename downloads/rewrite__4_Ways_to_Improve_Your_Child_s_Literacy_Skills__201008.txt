To be successful starting in pre-k, up to graduation, and throughout life beyond, your child needs the solid foundation you help them build when you encourage their enjoyment of reading. Read on to learn the many benefits of teaching your child how to read early. This article discusses developing social and emotional skills as well as language engagement. 

We will discuss next how to increase awareness. The article also covers the importance of reading twenty minutes every day. It will help you understand the importance of early reading to your child's development. For your child's life, the most important educator is you. Here are the 4 ways to help improve your child's literacy skills. 

1. Language Engagement

Your child's reading in the early years determines their success. A child will start absorbing language and use of expression through reading from birth. Babies start to master language skills at the first "coo" in their development. This critical step of their development will prepare a child for starting school. 

Engaging in language exchange with infants and toddlers puts a limit on the expressions and words that you use. One effective way of helping children build their vocabulary and literacy skills is by reading to them. 

2. Develops Social And Emotional Skills

Help children learn new phrases, words, and their uses by reading to them daily. It will help them improve their comprehension skills. A child's ability to focus and concentrate is also aided when you read to them. As the child is sitting there quietly and listening, they will learn how to be patient while you are turning the pages, and they will want to start participating in reading when they learn how to take turns. Reading consistently with your child as they are being read to encourages closeness. 

Because this is typically shared one on one, a bond is then formed with the parent or caregiver. Also, it builds emotional and social skills that are much-needed to function well later in life. 

3. Increases Awareness

Reading enhances a child's imaginative and creative skills and improves their verbal communication skills as well. Having these skills will allow them to socialize, empathize, rationalize, and in the long run, make new friends with ease. A child learns to use their imaginations while selecting choices from the variety of topics available for them to read from daily. 

It is through reading that children get to experience different worlds in their imagination, and this influences what they want to be in the future. Reading different books based on a variety of topics makes children aware of differences so that they can cope with changes quite quickly. 

4. Twenty Minutes A Day

Learning how to read can be challenging. Every child has individual temperament and attention span. Keep an eye on the clues your child gives you. Your child will not become frustrated, affecting their progress when you keep reading enjoyable and simple for them. Always remember, how long you read with your child is just as important as what you are reading to them. 

Take time to discuss with your children what you have just read. You should share reading with your child around 15 to 20 minutes each day, depending on their age. Studies show that doing this daily will expose your child to about 1.8 million words a year. 

The literacy skills your child needs to become a strong reader can start to develop at a very young age. You are establishing the foundation that your child needs for success during school and beyond into their life when you encourage them to develop a love of reading. We have explored how important it is to have early reading in childhood during this article. We went over language engagement first, including how to develop social and emotional skills.
