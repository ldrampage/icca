Listed below are just some of the many advantages and benefits that explain how important it is to read with your children. 

1. Reading Develops Language Skills

Though you talk to your children every day, the vocabulary you use with them is often repetitive and limited. Reading exposes your child to words and phrases covering different subject matters. It means they encounter words and phrases that they don't hear in their daily lives when reading a book. It would be better if your child has a wide vocabulary. 

Reading is a simple way to improve language skills and develop fluency, especially for a child who speaks more than one language. Reading is important in honing these skills. 

2. Encourages A Thirst For Knowledge

Reading to your child encourages them to ask questions about the details of the book you read to them. Giving children the chance to discuss what's happening in the book helps them learn. Their interest in different languages and cultures is also cultivated. It brings joy to see your child enjoying the process of learning. Reading to your child inspires them to ask questions about what's being read to them. 

To read about various topics, you should provide a wide range of books. Allow your child to learn about new things by letting them read about different reading materials covering various topics that may pique their interest. 

3. Teaches Children About Different Topics

Don't belittle the significance of reading various books to children. Your child will have a wider variety of information available to learn when you offer them books in a wide range of topics, as well as different languages for bilingual children. Choose books with varied topics to read for your kids. Let you child read various books about places, animals, objects.  

Look for books that teach children about essential life skills such as diversity, sharing, and kindness. A wonderful gift is giving one of the amazing personalized books. 

4. Develops A Child's Imagination

Watching a child's imagination grow is a wonderful benefit of reading with your child. Reading allows your child to visualize the characters of the book. We tend to view the setting as a reality. One of the beautiful things to see is how excited your child's eyes are when they know or guess what's going to happen when you flip the next page. 

Ask your kid to tell you the story or guess what happens next. It will help them to develop their creativity and have the freedom to explore their imagination wherever it takes them. 

5. Books Are A Form Of Entertainment

It is difficult not to be all caught up in the technology hype around us these days. Children love having access to all apps, smartphones, video games, and TV. Keep in mind that reading books that your child finds interesting can be just as fun. Selecting an exciting book to read with your child, or even allowing them to flip the pages alone, is a smarter option than all of the adverse effects of watching screens extendedly. 

One of the crucial benefits of reading with babies or toddlers is they will instead choose reading a book than any other activity for pleasure to relieve their boredom. Encouraging your kids to make reading a habit at a very young age will tend to choose reading books rather than other activities when they're bored. 

6. Creates A Bond

Nothing beats spending your time cuddling up to your child while reading a book or a bedtime story. Parents can grow closer to their children when they read, talk, and spend time together. Even if parents have a hectic schedule, it is still possible for them to relax and de-stress by spending some time reading with their kids. You can strengthen your parent-child relationship by spending more time with your child. 

One of the best ways to spend quality, one-on-one time with your child is through reading together during the day or bedtime. Talking about a book together with your child is an excellent opportunity to discover each other's thoughts, feelings, likes, and dislikes, and spending time with them shows them how valuable they are to you. This way can help develop their self-esteem and self-worth. 

7. Develops Empathy

When a child develops empathic feelings, you can also see another reason why reading is essential. It is possible when a child has the ability to place themself in the story. They feel what the characters they identify are feeling. Your child starts to figure out how to relate to emotions. As empathy takes a long time to develop in children fully, they begin to understand the feelings of others at around the age of six or seven years old. 

One of the ways children can learn about feelings is by reading books. Discussing how and why the characters in a story might be feeling, helps your child learn how to empathize. 

8. Sets Them Up For Success

Knowledge is essential in all areas of life, and your children will absorb more knowledge as you read to them. Based on several studies, babies and toddlers have a headstart for school and later on when you read to them. Reading with your children prepares them with the needed skills when they begin to read on their own. Children will become better readers later on when they benefit from critical pre-reading skills, such as turning pages and following words from left to right. 

When a child enjoys reading, they do well in all of the different subjects, not just in language and literacy. 

9. Promotes Brain Health

Stimulate your child's brain and help them boost their early reading skills by reading to them as often as you can. When young children are exposed to reading from an early age at home certain areas of the brain are influenced, according to research on the importance of reading. Developing a child's language skills in these areas is critical. When children are read to at an early age, critical areas of the brain needed for language development are affected, according to research. 

Their exposure to this will improve their ability to speak, learning to read, and communication skills. Children will excel in language, literacy, as well as all other subjects if they enjoy reading. 

10. Enhances Concentration

Reading with your child is crucial at this stage, even though it feels entirely frustrating reading to a toddler who continually wants to throw things around, swap books, and turn pages. You can help your child sit still for long periods and learn to concentrate when you read to them daily, this will help them later on in school. Your child will gradually learn to sit still for longer periods when you begin with reading to them in short bursts of time and make reading an enjoyable experience for them. 

They will enjoy talking to you about the pictures and listening to the voices you make. Doing so will help your child focus, which will eventually be beneficial when school starts. 

Parents should keep in mind that reading aloud to their children helps develop their early literacy and communication skills. You open your child's mind up to a larger and exciting world when you expose your child to wonderful new experiences. Your child will learn to love books as well as build their imagination. To encourage your child's desire and love for reading, they need to perceive it as enjoyable, engaging, positive, and fun. 

Do not discourage your child from reading by making them feel that your only intention is only to make them learn. Keep in mind that listening is gradually acquired art. When your child is primed for it, discussing different topics will spark new curiosity about their environment and will expand their thirst for knowledge as well.
