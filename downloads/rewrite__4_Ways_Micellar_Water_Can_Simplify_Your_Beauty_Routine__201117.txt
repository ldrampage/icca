Did you know that you can remove your makeup with micellar water? Usually, this step is done prior to washing your face in the evening with other cleansers.

2. About Micellar Water

You may be aware of a recent beauty trend of using micellar water in your beauty routine. It has been around for many years, even though it may seem new, and for some, it's the only thing they have used on their skin. In order for you to think about whether it is a good decision for you, it helps to know what it is. Even though it is popular now, micellar water isn't a new idea. Micellar water is simply a cleansing oil in tiny balls that are kept in purified water. 

Thanks to these little balls of oil, it doesn't dry your skin out when removing impurities from the skin. It takes the place of many beauty products that are used for the skin, and that makes it very convenient for traveling, and it's very popular. 

3. For Cleansing

Using micellar water on your skin to cleanse is just one of the ways you can use it. If you want to wash your face refreshingly and gently, wash your face with the water. The micellar water can work for you regardless if your skin is oily, dry, or combination skin. You can take it anywhere, so that makes it very convenient. 

If you are in a hurry and cannot do your normal cleansing regimen, it's a good option, or you may have forgotten and left your makeup on overnight. 

4. Post-Workout Cleanser

After a workout, your pores are open, and your face is sweaty, so you don't want to let it stay that way. This is many times what causes breakouts and acne. At least you can rinse your face with micellar water if you're too short of time for a full cleansing routine. Once your body heats up and opens your pores, you don't want to leave makeup sitting in those pores. 

You'll need to clean your face properly with micellar water and remove any makeup. It is essential to do this step. 

Although micellar is a thorough cleanser, it doesn't require any rinsing and is gentle. It works like a magnet that grabs the oil and lifts the dirt. This is good because it accomplishes this without any rough scrubbing. Your skin is left refreshed, clean, and hydrated.
