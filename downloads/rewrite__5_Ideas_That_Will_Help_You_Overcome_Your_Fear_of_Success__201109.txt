When you fail to follow through on all the plans you make for your life. You just don't bring it to fruition even if it's reading a book, working out more often, or starting a business. Every time you can nearly see success, you sabotage yourself. The majority of people you know just might fit this description. Is this description reflective of you? You can triumph over the fear of success and change your life for the better by using these strategies. 

5. Visualize It

Envision yourself to become more successful than you think. Visualize a new goal of making one million per year instead of your current goal of $100,000. Losing 25 pounds is a good goal, but if you want to see your abs, you're going to have to visualize it first. When you go to bed at night and get up in the morning do this. The visualization should be as real as you can make it. 

All five of your senses should be included. Relax and don't give up even if it doesn't feel comfortable. It will feel more natural as time goes by. It will be easier to reach your goal after that. 

4. Don't Think Act

Many people do not want to be the center of attention, so they are afraid of success. At some point, we figured out or were taught it was better to keep our head down rather than be noticed. Just do something that you would not normally do. For example, have your hair disheveled when you go out in public. You can practicing standing out during your everyday life in numerous ways. 

You could choose a new style of clothing. You could wait until it is really hot and put on some winter gloves and stroll around the mall. You might go shopping dressed in your very best. Or pick something that you are either really bad or good at, such as bowling, and do that in public. 

3. Reframe Failure

You may find out that you are really afraid of failure rather than success. Remember that when we fail at something, it's just a different outcome than we were looking for. You are not defined by it. Your failures do not define who you are. 

It just might be that you require a different approach, a little more time, or practice. You won't have anything to be afraid of if you regard failure in this way. 

2. Practice Standing Out

Place your focus on doing and not thinking. If we don't think about success, we won't fear it. If finding clients for your business requires that you send out 100 cold emails, then just get busy and do it. It becomes more and more complicated, the longer you dwell on it. Make a decision, then do the action. To some people it is always challenging to find a balance between thought and action. 

You will never make any progress when you spend too much time to picture what your project will look like and how awesome it would be if you don't put in enough time to work on it. 

Having significant success requires these two vital things: starting something and being in the right place at the right time. 

1. Imagine Being Successful

Make sure your future includes a genuine vision. Fear can be conquered with sufficient motivation. Think of an attainable future in your mind that is worth conquering any stumbling block. If you have an interesting future in mind, fear isn't going to be a problem. "Rome was not built in a day" is an old saying.  When you work towards your goal in a series of smaller goals, you will get that life you are wanting to create, just not in one single day. 

To achieve your desired end, you need to set weekly and daily goals and not get engrossed with how far you are. 

To help overcome your fears, create your own view of the future. Dealing with discomfort is something you need to learn how to deal with. Keep in mind that you can only live the life you have. Do not put limits on your life by letting fear in it.
