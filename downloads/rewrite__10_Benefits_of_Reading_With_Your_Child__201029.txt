When a child develops empathic feelings, you can also see another reason why reading is essential. It is possible when a child has the ability to place themself in the story. They can relate to the characters and feel how they feel. Your child starts to figure out how to relate to emotions. The development of a child's ability to empathize takes quite a long time and not until they are around six or seven years old that they start to understand the feelings of other people.

Reading with infants and toddlers is crucial, so don't worry if they seem to be interested only in flipping pages, swapping books, or throwing them around. You can help your child sit still for long periods and learn to concentrate when you read to them daily, this will help them later on in school. To start, make reading sessions with your child short to help them enjoy the process more and eventually keep them interested in reading for a longer time.
