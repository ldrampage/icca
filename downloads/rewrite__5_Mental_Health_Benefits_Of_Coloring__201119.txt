1. Eliminating Your Mental Stress

Constant mental stress is harmful to your health and can result in physical issues. It puts you at risk of developing digestive issues or high blood pressure. Instead of turning to alcohol or food to de-stress after a challenging day at work, keep assorted coloring pages and lovely crayons ready at home. Anxiety and stress are two mental conditions that go closely together. 

Thus, de-stressing can help to inhibit anxiety attacks from occurring and help you effectively deal with negative emotions. When you color, the activity in the amygdala — the part of your brain controlling your fight or flight response when you are under stress — is reduced. In simple words, coloring enables you to concentrate only on the activity and not on your worrying thoughts. 

2. Relieving Your Depression

Coloring therapy can be a mood booster when you're feeling depressed. When you're feeling down or unhappy, pick out positive theme coloring pages and use crayons with vivid colors. Pick striking crayon colors, like orange, yellow, or red, to stimulate your brain's emotional center while working on your masterpiece, such as colorful mandalas. As you color, keep saying positive affirmations to yourself and focus on positive thoughts. A lot of psychologists use art therapy via coloring activities to treat patients with depression. 

With the help of intricate designs, adult coloring books can hold a person's attention in productive activity. It makes this possible by taking away one's mind and focus from negative habits and issues.
