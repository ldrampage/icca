1. Be An Example

As you set the example, your kids learn from you. Read a book where your kids can "catch" you. Take the time to talk with them about the new skill you just experienced. While your children are doing their homework, you can do yours by sitting down and paying bills for example. If your children see you exhibit a desire to learn new things in addition to having a strong work ethic they will be more inclined to copy that behavior as they grow up. 

The opposite is, do not forget, also unfortunately true. If you have a frame of mind that says, "I could care less.",  don't be surprised if your kids follow suit. 

2. Talk Often

Have you asked your kid what they think or feel about their teacher, classroom, or the other kids in their class? Ask them if you don't know. Have a discussion with them about their favorite things at school as well as the things they don't care for. Allow your youngster the opportunity to talk to you about what let them down, what they are excited about, and what stresses them out each day. 

Praise their efforts and achievements to show you support and encourage them. Your child's speaking skills will also be enhanced. 

3. Show Interest

The support you give to your child should not be limited. Make sure you offer it to your child's teacher too. Get together with their teacher and keep in touch with them. By doing this, you'll be able to address any issues when they come to light. You will be able to ask questions when you are in constant communication with your child's teacher. 

When the teacher is concerned about your child they will be more confident about calling you. That you and the teachers see things the same way is the message your child is given. 

4. Expect Success

Expecting your child to be successful in school might be the most positive way of supporting their school efforts. We're not talking about requiring them to be the best athlete, the best artist, or the best student. Instead, you want them to be pleased with their achievements, and to do that, you'll want them to know that their best is what you expect. Provide an environment in your home that encourages learning and make sure your child understands what your expectations are. 

That will give your child a better opportunity to be the best that they can be. Everyone knows that it's a lot easier to do what is necessary when you are aware of what is expected of you. 

5. There Is Always Something To Learn

A key part of a child's overall knowledge comes from the things they learn at home, even if they are beyond their preschool years. Some people think that it's the teacher's and the school's responsibility to unravel everything besides keeping children safe, healthy, and learning. However, teachers are limited in what they can accomplish. Our job as parents is to provide all the support our kids need. During the day, check out for ways to teach your child. 

Both science and math are used when cooking as an example. Take the opportunity the next time you are cooking dinner to go over things like reading and following directions, making hypotheses (What happens when I beat the egg whites?"),  examining results, and discussing fractions. 

6. Create A Special Space

Parents who are experienced know-how important it is to be organized and have a place set apart for shoes, backpacks, lunch boxes, school projects, and shoes. Some parents refer to it as a staging area, and others refer to it as a launching pad. It doesn't have to be a big project, just installing a hook near the back door will suffice. It doesn't matter what you call it, as long as there is a place for your child to keep the things they need every day for school. 

It may not only help them to stay organized, but it's easy too. At the time the morning rush begins, you'll know right where to locate everything you need. 

7. Enforce Healthy Habits

When you are feeling ill, it's hard to do your best. When you implement habits that are good and healthy in your home, you are helping your youngster to be able to do their best at school. To ensure that your child gets all the sleep they need, select a bedtime that will allow that. Ensure that your child's daily breakfast is healthy. 

Limit the time your children play video games, watch TV, or listen to music, and inspire them to get some exercise. Be aware of the time your children spend on their computer, tablet, or phone. 

8. Read Read Read

People often say that learning to read takes the first several years of your child. They will then continue to spend their lifetime reading to learn. If you want your youngster to have the opportunity to become an enthusiastic and accomplished reader, read to them because it is the door to various methods of learning. Make an effort daily to read to your child even if it's only for a short time. 

While the most important thing is to have fun while reading, give them the chance to read to you too. Reading with your kids is important and cannot be emphasized enough, however, it shouldn't stress you out because you will be defeating the whole purpose. 

9. Designate A Space

Your child has a table or desk provided as a working space when they are at school. They have room to spread their work out and enough light to easily see what they are doing. Wouldn't your child benefit from having a place to do their homework that had similar surroundings? To make it more enjoyable and easier for kids to finish their homework, create a space that is just for them. 

A spot at the kitchen counter with a container of supplies is fantastic, and a desk is wonderful. Having a special area just for your child where they can also do their homework is what is important. 

10. Stick To A Routine

Having structure is something the majority of children thrive on. When you instill habits that keep them organized they will respond well. For instance, while you are preparing breakfast and their lunch as well as packing their backpack with homework and any forms that are required, they are making their bed, getting dressed, and eating their breakfast. You can give your kids a snack when they get home from school, and then while you are fixing dinner, they can do their homework. 

Although routines may vary, your child needs to know what to expect and keep it the same as much as possible. 

As you probably already know your home is the starting place for either failure or success. Researchers have connected poor academic performance to factors like obesity, poor nutrition, and lack of sleep. It also takes a toll when there isn't any parental support.
