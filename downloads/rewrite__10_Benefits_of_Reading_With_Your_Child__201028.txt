Researches have proven that reading daily to your toddlers and preschoolers will help build and improve their vocabulary. Reading with your child offers many benefits and advantages. Reading will help a child understand how to read and write and enhance their vocabulary and when you read aloud to a child you assist them in learning topics from everyday life and about the world. 

Read on to learn why it's important to read with your children. 

1. Reading Develops Language Skills

Though you talk to your children every day, the vocabulary you use with them is often repetitive and limited. Reading exposes your child to words and phrases covering different subject matters. This exposes them to vocabulary that may not be included in their everyday lives. It would be better if your child has a wide vocabulary. 

Reading is an easy way to help multilingual children improve their language skills as well as develop their fluency. The importance of reading is highlighted just by these skills alone. 

2. Encourages A Thirst For Knowledge

Reading to your child encourages them to ask questions about the details of the book you read to them. This allows you an opportunity for a learning experience to talk about what is going on around them. They may even find other languages and cultures interesting. It is rewarding to watch a child enjoy learning. Reading to your child inspires them to ask questions about what's being read to them. 

Strive to expose your child to books and other reading materials with diverse topics. Reading will encourage your child's interest in areas that they normally would not be exposed to, and is also a wonderful opportunity for them to learn several new things. 

3. Teaches Children About Different Topics

Just how important it is to read a wide diversity of books should never be overlooked. Your child will have a wider variety of information available to learn when you offer them books in a wide range of topics, as well as different languages for bilingual children. Choose books with varied topics to read for your kids. Different objects, places, or animals are topics that include informative books. 

Some important life skills like diversity, being kind, and sharing can be taught through other books. A wonderful gift is giving one of the amazing personalized books. 

4. Develops A Child's Imagination

Watching a child's imagination grow is a wonderful benefit of reading with your child. We imagine the actions of the characters when we interact with a book. Kids will think of the book's setting as real. One of the most beautiful things to watch is the excitement in a child's eyes when they already have a hunch on what comes next in the story, or letting them guess what will happen. 

You should encourage them to guess what would happen next, or tell the story themselves. It will stimulate and nurture your child's imagination and will encourage them to think outside the box. 

5. Books Are A Form Of Entertainment

These days, it's so easy for your kids to get consumed with technology and gadgets. Children love having access to all apps, smartphones, video games, and TV. Your child can find just as much entertainment when reading a good book. Selecting an exciting book to read with your child, or even allowing them to flip the pages alone, is a smarter option than all of the adverse effects of watching screens extendedly. 

One of the best benefits of how essential reading with babies and toddlers is, kids will choose to pick up a book and read for pleasure instead of any other activity. Instead of looking at the nearest screen to escape boredom, when we encourage our children to read as a habit, they will choose a book. 

6. Creates A Bond

Nothing beats spending your time cuddling up to your child while reading a book or a bedtime story. Parents can grow closer to their children when they read, talk, and spend time together. Merely relaxing with your child and reading is a beautiful way to enjoy spending time while you unwind for the day and just bond together, especially for busy working parents. You can strengthen your parent-child relationship by spending more time with your child. 

Spending quality one on one time reading together in the middle of the day or at bedtime is always an excellent opportunity. Reading together and talking about the story with your child opens an opportunity to discover each other's s dislikes, likes, feelings, and thoughts and shows them how valuable they are when you spend time with them. This way can help develop their self-esteem and self-worth. 

7. Develops Empathy

When a child develops empathic feelings, you can also see another reason why reading is essential. Something like this happens when a child can place himself in the story. They can feel what the character is feeling after identifying. It happens as children learn to relate to and understand emotions. The development of a child's ability to empathize takes quite a long time and not until they are around six or seven years old that they start to understand the feelings of other people. 

One of the ways children can learn about feelings is by reading books. Children will learn to gain the skill to empathize when you discuss how the characters of the story are feeling. 

8. Sets Them Up For Success

Knowledge is essential in all areas of life, and your children will absorb more knowledge as you read to them. Studies have shown that reading to your infants and toddlers prepare them for school and give them an advantage later on. By reading to your child, you help them learn the skills they need in starting to read by themselves. Reading words on a page from left to right and turning pages are essential pre-reading skills that children must learn even before they start school. 

When a child enjoys reading, they do well in all of the different subjects, not just in language and literacy. 

9. Promotes Brain Health

Reading to young children gives them a needed boost to support and promote their early reading skills as it affects their brain activity. Studies show that reading to infants and toddlers at home plays an essential role in boosting functions in specific areas of the brain. Developing a child's language skills in these areas is critical. Reading to young children helps boost specific areas of the brain, which are essential for language development. 

Their exposure to this will improve their ability to speak, learning to read, and communication skills. Children will excel in language, literacy, as well as all other subjects if they enjoy reading. 

10. Enhances Concentration

Reading with infants and toddlers is crucial, so don't worry if they seem to be interested only in flipping pages, swapping books, or throwing them around. Your child will learn to stay still and focus on the book for an extended period if you read to them often. To start, make reading sessions with your child short to help them enjoy the process more and eventually keep them interested in reading for a longer time. 

They will enjoy talking to you about the pictures and listening to the voices you make. Doing so will help your child focus, which will eventually be beneficial when school starts. 

Parents should keep in mind that reading aloud to their children helps develop their early literacy and communication skills. Through reading, your child gets to experience new and amazing things and excites their mind to a bigger world. Your child will learn to love books as well as build their imagination. Your child should regard reading as engaging, fun, entertaining, and enjoyable to spark their love for books and avidity to read. 

You can do more harm than good if your child believes that you are determined to make them learn and become discouraged and stubborn. Keep in mind that learning the art of listening is a process. When your child is primed for it, discussing different topics will spark new curiosity about their environment and will expand their thirst for knowledge as well.
