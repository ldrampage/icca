A ketogenic diet is based on high-fat and low carbs, and commonly called keto. There are many healthy benefits that happen with this diet. It adequately helps you to shed pounds as well as lifting your vitality levels, therefore, transforming your body into a fat-burning machine. Lowering your risk factor for getting some diseases as well as losing weight are some of the results of a ketogenic diet. 

As shown by research, keto is far more effective in losing weight than the traditional low-fat diets more commonly recommended for simple weight loss. 

1. Keto Won't Leave You Hungry

The keto diet requires that you eat a pre-set number of calories each day which will leave you full and satisfied, which is different than most diets. The keto method of dieting is both filling and satisfying. Having to track calories is a deterrent that keep many from sticking to the other diets, with this you don't track calories and still lose weight. Increasing protein intake is just one of many reasons that makes keto more effective than simple low-fat diets. 

Both metabolic health and weight reduction benefit when you have a higher protein intake. When you are reaching for ketosis, foods with a high carbohydrate content are best limited or totally removed. 

2. You Can Modify Meals When Eating Out

It is simple to eat in a keto-friendly manner when eating out. Fish and meat bases dishes are generally served in most restaurants. You can always substitute vegetables for a high-carb side dish when you order a plate. Another wonderful choice is having a meal of eggs, such as bacon and eggs or an omelet. They are good for dinner too, not just restricted to breakfast. Having a burger without the bun is also a keto favorite. 

Take that burger and add extra cheese, bacon, avocado and vegetables rather than eating that side of fries. Any meat on the menu at Mexican restaurants can be eaten. Toppings can be added like sour cream, guacamole, salsa and extra cheeses. Berries with cream or a mixed cheese plate are wonderful dessert options. 

3. You Can Lose Weight And Make Life Changes

Your life can also get more positive changes from keto, not just losing weight. In recent years the popularity of this low-carb, high-fat diet has resulted in a community of eaters that are praising keto. You lose weight from the ketosis process rather than depending on calorie restriction. Your body begins producing ketones for energy when you lower carbohydrate intake. 

Your liver produces ketones from either your body fat or the fatty acids in the food you eat. Body fat is burned by the liver to produce ketones. Instead of using carbs, ketones produce energy. 

4. You Can Eliminate Stubborn Belly Fat

A diet high in sugar and refined carbs, along with your genes, determines the amount of visceral fat, or belly fat. There is a danger to surrounding blood vessels when visceral fat becomes easily inflamed, this also makes it difficult to lose. Due to its anti-inflammatory characteristics, a well designed keto regimen can easily melt away stubborn belly fat. Although, if you have a large amount of belly fat, it is not likely that just keto by itself will be enough to lose all of it. 

Using high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercises along with keto is an excellent combination. Before starting a new exercise or diet program, consulting with your doctor is always best. 

5. Be Sure To Minimize Side Effects

Some people do experience a few side effects while adapting, however, most healthy people find a ketogenic diet safe. Lasting only a few days, this adjustment period is referred to as the "keto flu". The symptoms of a keto flu can include digestive discomfort, sleep disturbances, hunger or low energy. Being nauseous for the first days of keto is reported for some people. 

You can enter keto slowly to keep these effects down to a minimum. Rather than going straight to full keto, start first with a couple of weeks on a standard low-carb diet. Therefore, your body is being trained to burn more fat before you ever remove the carbs from your diet. 

6. Keto Is A Healthy Choice

If you are diabetic, prediabetic, overweight or just wanting to improve metabolism, a ketogenic diet is a fantastic choice. For others wanting to acquire significant muscle mass, such as bodybuilders or elite athelets, it may not be the best fit. You must be consistent on keto, just like any other diet, and stay on your plan. Research has consistently proven the ketogenic diet's powerful benefits of nutrition, health and weight loss. In addition to helping with diabetes and prediabetes, keto may also be good for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. 

Keto seems to lower HDL cholesterol levels more than other diets that also allow consumption of moderate carbohydrates. This improvement to health is driven by adding healthier foods and losing more weight. 

Some of the world's most pressing health issues now are metabolic diseases and obesity. In any given year, obesity issues cause more than 2.8 million deaths in adults. In the US, over 50 million people are affected by metabolic syndrome leading to numerous health issues. While most are not backed with research, many diets have shown up to combat this. 

Research has proven the benefits of a ketogenic diet have been well documented by science. When compared with other diets for weight loss, a ketogenic diet helps you to increase feelings of fullness, reduce caloric intake and burn fat.
