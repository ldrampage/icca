1. Reading Develops Language Skills

Though you talk to your children every day, the vocabulary you use with them is often repetitive and limited. Reading books assures your child's exposure to vocabulary on diverse topics. It means they encounter words and phrases that they don't hear in their daily lives when reading a book. They are better off when they know more words. 

Reading is a simple way to improve language skills and develop fluency, especially for a child who speaks more than one language. Reading is important in honing these skills. 

2. Encourages A Thirst For Knowledge

Reading to your child encourages them to ask questions about the details of the book you read to them. Giving children the chance to discuss what's happening in the book helps them learn. Their interest in different languages and cultures is also cultivated. It is rewarding to watch a child enjoy learning. Reading to your child inspires them to ask questions about what's being read to them. 

To read about various topics, you should provide a wide range of books. Reading will encourage your child's interest in areas that they normally would not be exposed to, and is also a wonderful opportunity for them to learn several new things. 

3. Teaches Children About Different Topics

Don't belittle the significance of reading various books to children. Your child will have a wider variety of information available to learn when you offer them books in a wide range of topics, as well as different languages for bilingual children. Select a variety of books to read. Different objects, places, or animals are topics that include informative books. 

Some important life skills like diversity, being kind, and sharing can be taught through other books. A wonderful gift is giving one of the amazing personalized books. 

4. Develops A Child's Imagination

Watching a child's imagination grow is a wonderful benefit of reading with your child. Reading allows your child to visualize the characters of the book. We tend to view the setting as a reality. One of the most beautiful things to watch is the excitement in a child's eyes when they already have a hunch on what comes next in the story, or letting them guess what will happen. 

Ask your kid to tell you the story or guess what happens next. It will stimulate and nurture your child's imagination and will encourage them to think outside the box. 

5. Books Are A Form Of Entertainment

These days, it's so easy for your kids to get consumed with technology and gadgets. Children are drawn to smartphones, video games, television, and apps. Keep in mind that reading books that your child finds interesting can be just as fun. Help lessen the negative impact of too much screen time by reading compelling books with your child or just letting your child flip through pages. 

One of the best benefits of how essential reading with babies and toddlers is, kids will choose to pick up a book and read for pleasure instead of any other activity. Encouraging your kids to make reading a habit at a very young age will tend to choose reading books rather than other activities when they're bored. 

6. Creates A Bond

Nothing beats spending your time cuddling up to your child while reading a book or a bedtime story. Reading, talking, and spending time together helps strengthen the bond between parents and children. Merely relaxing with your child and reading is a beautiful way to enjoy spending time while you unwind for the day and just bond together, especially for busy working parents. You create a healthy relationship bond with your child when you spend time with them.

Talking about a book together with your child is an excellent opportunity to discover each other's thoughts, feelings, likes, and dislikes, and spending time with them shows them how valuable they are to you. This way can help develop their self-esteem and self-worth. 

7. Develops Empathy

When a child develops empathic feelings, you can also see another reason why reading is essential. It happens when children put themselves in the character's shoes. They can relate to the characters and feel how they feel. Your child starts to figure out how to relate to emotions. As empathy takes a long time to develop in children fully, they begin to understand the feelings of others at around the age of six or seven years old. 

A way for children to learn about feelings is by reading stories. Discussing how and why the characters in a story might be feeling, helps your child learn how to empathize. 

8. Sets Them Up For Success

Knowledge is essential in all areas of life, and your children will absorb more knowledge as you read to them. Based on several studies, babies and toddlers have a headstart for school and later on when you read to them. Reading with your children prepares them with the needed skills when they begin to read on their own. Reading words on a page from left to right and turning pages are essential pre-reading skills that children must learn even before they start school. 

Children will perform well in language as well as their other subjects if they enjoy reading. 

9. Promotes Brain Health

Reading to young children gives them a needed boost to support and promote their early reading skills as it affects their brain activity. When young children are exposed to reading from an early age at home certain areas of the brain are influenced, according to research on the importance of reading.

10. Enhances Concentration

Reading with your child is crucial at this stage, even though it feels entirely frustrating reading to a toddler who continually wants to throw things around, swap books, and turn pages. You can help your child sit still for long periods and learn to concentrate when you read to them daily, this will help them later on in school. Your child will gradually learn to sit still for longer periods when you begin with reading to them in short bursts of time and make reading an enjoyable experience for them. 

They will enjoy talking to you about the pictures and listening to the voices you make. Doing so will help your child focus, which will eventually be beneficial when school starts. 

Parents should keep in mind that reading aloud to their children helps develop their early literacy and communication skills.

Your child should regard reading as engaging, fun, entertaining, and enjoyable to spark their love for books and avidity to read. 

You can do more harm than good if your child believes that you are determined to make them learn and become discouraged and stubborn. Keep in mind that listening is gradually acquired art. You should progress slowly, then when your child is ready, change the subject matter to ignite the next round of curiosity about the world they see around them to expand their level of interest to want more.
